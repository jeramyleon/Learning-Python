Threads: An entity within a process that can be scheduled (also known
as lightweight process). A process can spawn multiple threads.

+ All threads within a process share the same memory 
+ lightweight
+ Starting a thread is faster than starting a process 
+ Great for I/O-bound tasks 

- Threading is limited by GIL: Only one thread at a time 
- No effect for CPU-bound tasks
- Not interruptable/killable
- Careful with race conditions
