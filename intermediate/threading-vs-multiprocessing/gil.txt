GIL: Global interpretor lock
- A lock that allows only one thread at a time to execute in Python
- Needed in CPython because memory managemnet is not thread-safe

- Avoid:
    - Use multiprocessing
    - Use a different, free-threaded Python implementation(Jython,
    IronPython)
    - Use python as a wrapper for a third-party libraries (C/C++) ->
    numpy, scipy
