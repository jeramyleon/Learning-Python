DATA ON THE WEB 
- With the HTTP Request/Response well understood and well supported, there 
was a natural move toward exchanging data between programs using these 
protocols
- We needed to come up with an agreed way to represent data going between
applications and across networks
- There are two commonly used formats: XML and JSON
---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
ExTENSIBLE MARKUP LANGUAGE
- Primary purpose is to help information systems share structured data 
- It started as a simplified subset of the Standard Generalized Markup
Language (SGML), and is designed to be relatively human-legible
----------------------------------------------------------------------
XML TERMINOLOGY 
- Tags indicate the beginning and ending of elements 
- Attributes - Keyword/value pairs on the opening tag of XML
- Serialize/De-Serialize - Convert data in one program into a common 
format that can be stored and/or transmitted between systems in a 
programming language-independent manner
