Relational Power 
- By removing the replicated data and replacing it with references to a single 
copy of each bit of data we build a "web" of information that the relational
database can read through very quickly - even for very large amounts of data 
- Often when you want some data it comes from a number of tables linked by these 
foreign keys 
---------------------------------------------
The JOIN Operation
- The JOIN operation links across several tables as part of a select operation
- You must tell JOIN how to use the keys that make the connection between the 
tables using an ON clause
